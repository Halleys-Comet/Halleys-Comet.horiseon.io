#Horiseon Refactor Challenge 

## Description 

In this challenge I was tasked to refactor code to help it meet accessibilty standards for a company called Horiseon. To start I added comments to break the HTML and CSS codes into sections so I could focus on one section at a time. There wasn't much of a title, so I updated to the title to show "Horiseon"

The next section I looked at were the Anchor element links to make sure they took us where we needed to go when click. I needed to add an id in order to get the Search Engine Optimization link to work. 

For the content section I added article tags to help clean up a lot of the divs, and to keep each of those sections independent of one another. I created one class for each of the articles to help clean up the CSS code and consolidated a lot of repeating code. 

The Benefits section was similar. Created one class for each one in order to consolidate a lot of the CSS code. And for the footer section I eliminated the <div class="footer>. This is unnecessary since you can used the footer tag.

One of the last things I did was add alt text to each of the images that are on the site. This will also help with accessiblity to help describe the pictures to viewers who are unable to see them.
